    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="about-content">
      I'm <span class="highlight">Shalini</span>, a final-year <span class="highlight">B.E. CSE</span> student who is enthusiastic about 
      <span class="highlight">tech innovation, programming, and web development</span>.
      I like to solve logical puzzles and create responsive websites.  
      In addition to working on academic projects, I gained practical coding experience as an intern at 
      <span class="highlight">Tap Academy, Bengaluru</span>.  
      My objective is to work as a software engineer who specializes in developing effective and significant solutions.  
      Growing through every tech difficulty is something I firmly believe in: 
      <em>"Learning to build, and building to learn."</em>
